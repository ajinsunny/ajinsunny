# Ajin Sunny

Hi there :slightly_smiling_face:

I'm a Software Engineer working at Outco Inc.

Having a good habit of writing clean and documented code, I love working on complex problems using code. As a software engineer, I am language-agnostic, however, I am proficient in Python and C++. 

I believe that solving problems require critical thinking and problem-solving acumen such as breaking down the fundamentals using a design workflow using UML Diagrams and Class Diagrams.

<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer at a Stealth Startup in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a background in Electrical Engineering with Computer Science and Mathematics. I am proficient in data structures and algorithms and have a good habit of writing clean and documented code. In the past, I have worked as a Software Engineer and Graduate Associate for University of Kentucky. I love working on complex problems using code. As a software engineer, I am language-agnostic, however, I am proficient in Python and C++. I believe that solving problems require critical thinking and problem-solving skills such as breaking down the fundamentals using a software flow or a design workflow rather than being obsessed with code or the language itself. 

During my free time, I work on open source projects and collaborate with other software developers on  Github. My hobbies include running, working out, and bowling. 

Proficient Skills: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Git, SVN
