# Ajin Sunny

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software engineer with experience in developing web applications and a passion for solving complex problems.

I have expertise in several programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and C++. My strong understanding of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and React, as well as back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express, allow me to create interactive and dynamic web applications.

I have a track record of delivering high-quality projects on time and within budget. Whether it's working on an Agile team or leading a project independently, I have a proven ability to turn ideas into functional and user-friendly web applications.

I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. In my free time, you'll find me exploring open-source projects or contributing to my own.

If you're looking for a driven and enthusiastic full-stack developer, look no further! Let's build something great together!

<!-- ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer at a Stealth Startup in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have a background in Electrical Engineering with Computer Science and Mathematics. I am proficient in data structures and algorithms and have a good habit of writing clean and documented code. In the past, I have worked as a Software Engineer and Graduate Associate for University of Kentucky. I love working on complex problems using code. As a software engineer, I am language-agnostic, however, I am proficient in Python and C++. I believe that solving problems require critical thinking and problem-solving skills such as breaking down the fundamentals using a software flow or a design workflow rather than being obsessed with code or the language itself. 

During my free time, I work on open source projects and collaborate with other software developers on  Github. My hobbies include running, working out, and bowling. 

Proficient Skills: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Git, SVN
